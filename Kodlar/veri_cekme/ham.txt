The uncontrolled spread of #COVID19 in our communities and the number of individuals requiring hospitalization are threatening to overwhelm our hospital and healthcare systems. Do your part: Get vaccinated; take action to stop the spread; isolate if you are sick or test positive.

Oh, I see. Yes, if we could develop good anti-COVID treatments without side effects, that would be better than vaccines with side effects. Big *if*, though. 

The alternative to vaccination is COVID19 without vaccination. Vax risks need to be compared to (greater) COVID19 risks.

I finally got to lay eyes on my eldest son who had #Covid19. He still deals with SOB once in awhile. He was glad to be vaxxed. A motorcycling friend of his succumbed to it earlier this month, weeks on a vent. Not vaxxed. It isn't something to mess with.

Those who have had #COVID19 should look into possibility of specific antibody tests that can prove infection vs antibodies produced by vaccination alone (there are differences, mostly in numbers and types).
This might help when the #bcndp try to deny you future benefits.

No it wasn’t it’s from the coronavirus family, so is SARRs and MERs, but this was new which is why it’s called covid19. The year it was diagnosed. Its zoonotic and came from bats. There are 300+ zoonotic viruses some deadly including rabies, zika, nipah, all could be pandemic.
Indeed if PPVs had been accounted for from the beginning there would be less reason for doctors and patients to believe unconfirmed cases of covid. So how could belief be a better predictor of covid19 than +s when that belief is derived from reported +s cases to begin with?
Those screaming "#ImpeachBiden" forget one thing: The Republicans as well as the Democrats wanted this illegal and unconstitutional casserole of  (open borders, hyper-inflation, #COVID19 mandates, etc.). Why do you think McConnell ordered the @SenateGOP to certify  Joe?

No mandates. I took three Pfizer shots. And I would gladly take #4. I have not had COVID19 since March 2020. I do not want a repeat. But it is my medical choice based on my research, medical history, and doctors’ recommendations. Not my job or government forcing me to take it.
Dec 17, 2020. Vaccine #1. Full of gratitude (but also a little scared, honestly). I knew that I was a sitting duck and the vaccine was my best option for preventing #COVID19.

The issue of workplace safety and #COVID19 vaccination has been largely absent from the national conversation. Nevertheless, one workwear company is standing firm on these mandates and requirements: http://bit.ly/Crtt35386 via @TinaMCasey
Do. You. Hear. Yourselves. Medical. Community.?

And stories about medical personnel who are no longer able to work due to long haul covid19. How long did they work while infected & how many did they infect?

Guess what, it's not tracked. But public is?
Science says it takes 90 days for covid19 to leave an infected person's body. But now, evidence is refuting that scientific claim, as more and more people are easily reinfected. 

The consistent factor, is medical personnel treating covid19+ patients who are vaxed too.

A previous #COVID19 infection can provide some protection, but this protection decreases significantly over time. Even if you’ve had COVID-19, get vaccinated to help add protection to your immune system and lower chances of acquiring symptomatic COVID-19. http://bit.ly/3KEeAZE

#COVID19 vaccine boosters increase protection against death from the Omicron variant to 95% in people aged 50 and over, according to the UK Health Security Agency
Since the start of the pandemic, 901,569 Americans have died from #COVID19 (15.9% of all deaths worldwide). That is about the same as 56,348 2015 San Bernardino attacks which killed 16 people in 2015:
Age standardized rates can be very misleading. You think there's a huge fix needed in a given group but their overall impact and potential upside is small because the group itself is small.

You all state protocols when a few in medical community refuse to get Covid19 vaccine, won in courts lately. You all say a small % unvaxed ppl spreads Covid19. Many left to earn more $ in outbreak areas. You all need to look in the mirror, stop the god complex pats on the backs.
Add break thru infections despite KN95 masks, amongst medical staff, when medical unions are winning in courts to stay unvaxed, mRNA doesn't change DNA, but a Covid19 infection does. 

Stop. You're telling by actions what you really think about preexisting health conditions.
Who are you protecting the preexisting patient from by demanding a covid19 vax? The unvaxxed amongst you? Stop. You're burying yourself. Your conscious is showing. Go pile elsewhere. 

This is why I'm questioning preexisting patients must be vaxed against Covid-19. https://twitter.com/meh0218/status/1486825869419204612…

Mentioned on @checkupcbc this evening how dictators tend to follow each other. No more so than during #COVID19 pandemic when they used opportunity to level playing field in their favour. Am afraid it’s happening now. More here http://digitalpandemicbook.com #Ukraine #UkraineRussiaWar
Considering the low vaccine rate among school kids, this is so dangerous for families with preexisting conditions and elderly living at home. May I direct the @NYCMayor to @edyong209 article about being #immunocompromised during #COVID19 crisis. https://theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/02/covid-pandemic-immunocompromised-risk-vaccines/622094/…
.@POTUS we need to get #COVID19  vaccines to all countries because Human lives matter  The US must support sharing and manufacturing to help the world meet 70% vaccination by mid-2022.
Thank you so much for covering this important topic @CynthiaMcFadden. America needs to know that hospitalization and death should not be our only metrics against #COVID19. The disability sustained from LongCOVID is very real.
Aside from the humour, it's another indication that Putin has lost it. He's been isolated at best of times, with only a few sycophants by his side, but socially distanced. He's incredibly paranoid about #COVID19, that's why all his meetings look like this. He is mentally unstable
About sixteen million (78%) Sri Lankans have gotten at least one vaccine dose so far!

Here’s a look at our #COVID19 indicators for Sunday, February 27:

• 16,910,906 vaccine doses administered
• 28 new hospitalizations
• 619 new cases

Get vaccinated: http://nyc.gov/vaccinefinder
Get tested: http://nyc.gov/covidtest
More data: http://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid…
I gave blood in Overland Park a few weeks ago.  The nurse said it was because of all the people that had #COVID19  that they were short on blood.  How can you be against mandates to keep people from getting COVID and not understand the blood shortage? https://redcross.org/about-us/news-and-events/press-release/2022/blood-donors-needed-now-as-omicron-intensifies.html…
Is #COVID19 an absolute truth which cannot be refuted, only denied? If it is, how is that the case? If it isn't, what you have written here is meaningless.
Just keep following the (political) science folks! #COVID19 #NYC #EndTheMandatesNow

Do I agree w the CDC's new Covid19 policies? NO, they imperil too many

Am I disappointed w the Administration? 
VERY

Will I support the GOP going forward? 
NO, they have become authoritarian & anti democracy & are in the thrall of a dangerous unstable loser
Biden's plan to send #COVID19 tests to millions of American households was not only a massive failure, but it was also too little, too late. I explain why in my latest from @realclearpolicy. https://buff.ly/3sA3MmT
I keep hearing failed Biden policies. First it was the two week shutdown. Then social distancing. Then a mask mandate. Then requiring vaccines for some workers against their will. None of those COVID19 policies has any effect on the spread of the virus.
I mean, the *measles* vaccine for kids isn't "perfect". It's a damn sight better than measles. The *CUBAN* Covid19 vaccine isn't perfect- but if I had a kiddo2-4 and I could get it for them, I would. Covid is a bitch, even for littles (worse for 0-2 than 2-4, actually)

If you’ve been exposed to #COVID19 and are unvaccinated or not up to date with vaccines, stay home for five days. Get tested on day five after exposure or if symptoms develop during quarantine. Continue to wear a mask for five additional days. More: http://covid.ri.gov/whattodo
Published. How many paper reviews have you experienced since then that support your paper as reliable science showing ivermectin effectiveness against COVID19?
As far as I know the #UK is the only major European country not reporting the #Covid19 deaths at weekends.
It is horrific to have this stat available and people out there who will not only dispute covid and the danger it poses, but will recklessly advise people on ignoring and opposing and safety guidelines.

Who would’ve thought that it took two years and a WAR to end COVID19?!
Do you still think inflation peaked?  I know Covid19 seems over, nice call on that one by the way, though I still think next winter could be bad.

I'm having trouble with the term "vulnerable folks."
Who *isn't* #vulnerable to a #Covid19 infection?

Vaccines protect against severe disease and death much better than against infection...and even a mild infection can lead to #LongCovid. 

Also, vax efficacy wanes over time.
Making up policy on the hoof was how they worked with #COVID19, often evidence free, and many commentators were more than happy with that.
It’s like Cant’t Get COVID19 if You Don’t Test!
Where's is the Covid19 case? Are there no more Covid19 variants any more?
Among large states NY has highest rate of adults fully vaccinated for #COVID19, highest rate of teenagers fully vaccinated & 2nd-highest rate of children 5-11 fully vaccinated. NYS has had 98% decline in COVID19 cases since #Omicron peak & continuous downward trend for 51 days.
.@GovKathyHochul is ending state mask requirement in schools starting Mar 2 based on #COVID19 data trends & health & ed experts & parents, teachers & school administrators. Also follows changes in .@CDCgov metrics determining risk, transmission. Other mitigation measures remain.
People have had #Covid19 more than once

 Let's turn our attention to #RussiaUkraineWar and the naked aggression Rusian leadership has undertaken.

Most of the jury have returned with their verdict: ivermectin is not a useful treatment for COVID19.
Of course, science research may yet uncover something new, but until then..
Hey numb nuts, I have had covid19 and it lasted a couple days. Before you jump up on your soapbox, I’m 63 diabetic, hypertensive, overweight but still relatively healthy as I take medication to control things like blood pressure and sugar. Covid19 is not a death sentence.

Disappointing but it's the way things are right now so whatever.

But the one person tells me they'll "get a vaccine when there is one". Because they believe these are not real vaccines.

Its a complicated story. Vaccination has definitely made the difference in not getting #COVID19 or getting milder version. However now the cases have fallen from 10,000 a day in the end of December to 480 a week ago to 280/day now. Meaning if you are vaccinated you are safe
They lied before COVID19..., but it was quite harder to connect the dots.
I want to thank the millions of New Yorkers who masked up and helped us reach unprecedented levels of vaccinations. 

I also want to thank @GovKathyHochul for her partnership in the fight against #COVID19 and for making clear that our parents should be part of this conversation.

No, nothing like it, the CDC only counts a covid death as a covid death if covid19 is a cause of death on a death certificate. Dying "with" isn't counted

Correction: holy **** he was not using irony  
Hint: good science shows ivermectin versus COVID19 has no benefit.
It also just came out Moderna has a patent for Covid19, you don't hear nothing from the mainstream media.
Ending school mask mandates puts peoples lives in danger, esp students, teachers, & staff who are immunocompromised, or at high-risk for severe #Covid19 due to diabetes, heart conditions, cancer, disabilities, pregnancy, smokers, or other health issues
Plus we have several approved therapies that are 70-90% effective; monoclonal antibodies were under-used and Paxlovid just came out.

Aren’t there more ways to address the pandemic than just vaccines?

REMINDER TO UK COFFICERS: In light of #coronavirus #COVID19, you are not working from a Coffice this week. Practice #socialdistancing, but if you must consume your usual Coffice-made beverage, have it delivered or get it to go, and go home. Stay healthy, folks! #washyourhands
What was #Ukrania economy like before Covid19 and after Covid19 restrictions ? 

What did they export as a country ? 

I know small countries would need international aid financial to survive
If masks reduce the spread of #COVID19 then ending mask mandates while there are a significant number of infections will lead to some infections that don't need to happen.

Is there anything factually wrong with this statement?
The names of thousands of #companies which benefited from billions of £ of #Covid19 loans schemes are to be kept confidential under new government rules to only publish state subsidies of >£500k. Campaigners says transparency would aid fight against #fraud - estimated at £4.9bn

So with the world staring into the abyss and #WW3 only a few minutes away from midnight (metaphorically speaking) who's still spreading the now defunct  #covid19 narrative? .@chrischirp .@dgurdasani1
Could we not also have lowered hospitalization by focusing on health?

Inactivity is the second leading risk factor after age.

Did #COVID19 lockdowns save lives? Yes! But, not for the reason you think. 

Instead of "flattening the curve" they made it "sharper" which meant  cases. 

Back in 2020, @MOUGK, @alison_l_hill, et al, & I predicted this would happen w/ network science.

It began with pictures and videos from Ch!na with bodies dead in the streets. The media ran wild with it and the fear began. I never once wore a mask while out in public by myself. I hugged my friend who was covid19 positive. I did increase my vitamin intake of zinc, D and C.

Many of our #COVID19 vaccine events also offer flu vaccine. It is safe to get both at the same time. For our listing of events for this coming week, visit http://maricopa.gov/COVID19VaccineLocations… and check if they're also offering flu shots.

People with kidney failure or a transplant need more shots of the #COVID19 vaccine than non-immunocompromised people to be fully vaccinated against the new variant. Trouble getting those additional doses? Refer your pharmacist to the CDC guidance chart: https://bit.ly/3JA2Plt
Even the docs have #MFP. Chill out, dude! How would you have handled it before #COVID19? Oh, that's right we didn't have 24x7x365 fearmongering over a fucking cold/flu virus whose case #s were grossly overstated by med fraud. Your kids need exposure 4 their immune systems to dev.
Well... The Western countries need an accountability for the funds they've wired this regime to fight against COVID19. Not that this govt cares for the kids, it's another way of attracting more funding from them.

I think the right-wing anti-democracy fascist party and the business communities in the United States have forced leadership to lift covid19 restrictions too early. It's political.  It's why there are a million dead (under counted) and  thousands still dying every day.

It's scary how fast people stopped caring.
Especially when we have so many scary variants already starting to chip away at BA.2's dominance.

But do they even know about them?
If they stopped caring back during BA.1, they have no idea what's about to hit.

That includes the bride. But if you want to know how to put that “in sickness and in health” thing in action, having discordant #COVID19 test results when you should be honeymooning is one way.

Sigh. Masks reduce droplet spread & act as source control. Ffp2+ protect the wearer. Flu is droplet (& aerosol) spread, like covid19. Who would handsomely reward me? Am I in the pocket of ‘big mask’? Maybe ‘big ‘flu’?

So, my husband’s positive was likely contracted at a training session on Sunday, which nearly all staff members attended. No one but him wearing a mask, so I guess they’ll be out of business at least a few days (essential service). #COVID19

This is the science that was apparent even in early 2020 that the Government were not following on #COVID19 now they’re trying to claim the care home deaths were unforeseeable because they didn’t know about asymptomatic transmission.
They are lying…again.

If @WHCOVIDResponse wants Congress to pass additional #Covid19 funding it doesn't seem like getting Fauci to go on national tv and tell everyone we are done with the pandemic in the US is the right approach.

Also not smart if they want more people to get vaccinated & boosted.

I've been wearing two masks at work since July 2020. I've had a surgery with no mask. I've had dental work with no mask. I managed to stay #covid19 free (without the vaccine until January 2022 when I reluctantly took the Pfizer vaccines). https://twitter.com/MeerkatEyes/status/1519146379897147392…
Why won’t she or Byeden publicly address medications they were given when they tested + for COVID19? If they really wanted to save lives, they would explain in detail the medical regimen that they took. Notice no public official has ever addressed what they took after testing +.

This would also be accurate:

"According to the UKHSA tables your chance of dying over 60 with #covid19 following a 3rd dose of vaccine is 3x higher because there are 3x more people who had a 3rd dose than all other groups - and dose 3 does not reduce your risk of dying"

7) Side note — #COVID19 testing in kids in 2020 and early 2021 was extremely less common because there was an assumption COVID was rare in kids. Thus many infections in kids maybe have likely been undetected. Also adenovirus could have been a recent exacerbating factor.

I was walking in Chelsea last week, talking to someone about how wonderful it was #COVID19 was over when a stranger interjected it was not stating Spanish Flu lasted five years.

Pretty sure last case of Spanish Flu was recorded in Australian in the 50's. 
Don't know about virulence at that point but don't expect #COVID19 will be over any time soon.

Tragic story. Get your meningitis vaccines(I wasn’t a fan of the covid19 vax, didn’t react well to it, I have health issues, I don’t react well to a lot of stuff) but meningitis shots was a breeze, no bad after effects at all. Lots of people get flu shots but not meningitis shots
It's official guys. A 3 seperate sick customer at work coughed and gagged all over me without a mask.

This has me wondering if our current #COVID19 policies are sufficient. Supply shortages are due to unanticipated rise in demand.

Sadly, we no longer have solid data to guide us on this.
It may go without saying, but I’ll say it anyway for the gen’l public. Even if you aren’t hospitalized for #COVID19, even if you don’t die, even if you don’t get #LongCovid, etc, being in & out (mostly in ) isolation for 4 wks is  & impacts EVERYTHING. #WearAMask. #MedTwitter
COVID19 history is in a MUSEUM. Throwing some cash that way, several millions from COVID RELIEF FUND, will in some way make a difference. To Jill? Can she be a docent?

There still exist mask sentries in nearly all healthcare facilities since COVID19. They sit there do nothing but making sure you’re wearing a  virus porous mask. How hard would it be to provide someone to simply open/close the main entrance in a school like #Uvalde

According to the the World Health Organisation, a person once infected with #COVID19 can  spread the virus for only 2 weeks after being infected.
However it is two years after the #pandemic was announced and we are still in that same global health crisis..
I have noticed a correlation between severity of CoVid & political leanings. Right wing, evidence based rational people have mild symptoms whereas hysterical, emotion, fear driven Leftists who are triple jabbed & masked have severe symptoms.

Could not agree more. Already ~20% of Perth Metro area health care workers are #COVID19 positive or close contacts. This has dramatically impaired delivery of both elective and urgent patient care. We have to protect nurses et al., better.
Another crisis story where #AndrewsGovernmentFail to mandate masks or isolate close contacts to drive Covid19 transmission down. Just keep  school camps,  keep putting 900 unmasked kids in a school hall with no windows. Look away, nothing to see.

What I AM invalidating is their exclusive use of personal anecdotes to argue that #covid19 is no big deal and therefore not worthy of infection control measures.
I have been accused of invalidating the experiences of people who state they had mild symptoms of #COVID19. That’s a red herring. I wasn’t there when they had covid and can’t possibly validate their claims.
Second booster is kinda rough, but probably so much better than catching #COVID19

16/ We did reject some stuff that early science seemed to say was useful, but in the end did not pan out with #COVID19.  When's the last time you clorox-wiped your delivered groceries, for example?

But masks are low-invasiveness and high-yield, so they've persisted.
15/  The analogy doesn't hold strictly for an airborne illness.  You can't catch #HIV from a person coughing in the seat next to you.  So the #COVID19 measures (and the balance between effectiveness and palatability) will be somewhat different.

But the principles are the same.

Imagine, medical staff refusing to treat a COVID19 patient who refuses to wear a mask & says COVID19 is a hoax. But I don't have to imagine cops standing around whilst children are shot dead. If only we treated cops like heroes, right!? Not respectfully, eat sh!t.

Strange how with #COVID19 there's outrage, rightly so, about health officials hiding information and refusing to say the spread is airborne.

Trump killed off a chunk of his own voters with his mismanagement of Covid19.  More MAGAs died because they refused to social distance, wear a mask or get vaccinated. Have you looked at fatality data in swing states and compared to his margins of loss.
I've had two doses of the #Pfizer vaccine, & a half-dose of #Moderna for a booster. I tested positive a couple of months ago, & it was "really like nothing at all" for me too. I just had a slightly drippy nose every now & then, & the occasional slightly "wheezy" cough.

Thankfully (*fingers crossed*) average daily deaths from #COVID19 in #Indiana have remained low and even continued to decline. We're currently averaging just 2.3 deaths/day, which is extremely low. No sign of even the smallest spike following this most recent wave. /7
It's the same story with the number of people hospitalized for #COVID19 in #Indiana. After a brief decline, we're now back up to the highest number of people hospitalized for the disease since March. /6
We're also seeing a steady rise in hospital admissions for #COVID19 in #Indiana. While it seemed like admissions for this wave had peaked at 84/day at the start of June, they've since risen beyond this to 87/day. Still historically quite low, but concerning. /5
You can see that a 17.3% #COVID19 test positivity rate is historically very high for #Indiana. This likely suggests official testing is missing a LOT of infections. With declining official testing and so much at-home (unrecorded) testing this shouldn't really be a surprise. /4
Probably most concerning at the moment is the positivity rate for #COVID19 tests in #Indiana, which after dropping from 16.8% to 15.0%, has since rebounded to 17.3%, higher than all points other than (1) the start of the pandemic and (2) the worst of the winter Omicron wave. /3
Shocked? COVID19 deaths are still rising although these numbers may be due to delays in reporting from Federal aged care

In the face of the great resignation, w/ #PublicHealth leaders and professionals at all levels leaving the field after two years of stress, burnout, and harassment during #COVID19, it is clear that we must make add'l #CABudget investments in recruitment and retention.
The $300M historical #CABudget investment, combined w/ $75.6 million in 1-time #PublicHERO funding, will begin to reverse the past decade of disinvestment that left communities vulnerable during #COVID19 & led to increased rates of STIs, syphilis & chronic diseases like diabetes.

So HR sends us an email a few mins ago saying the office is closed bc ppl testing POSITIVE FOR #COVID19 bc they’ve been having mtgs UNMASKED & a corp-wide mtg (last week) w/ ppl traveling frm all over the country. 
So now the MFers have to all get tested.
5% of hospitals with covid (on the rise) encouraged to come forward and get the jab… the jab that has now had at least 4 shots and is actually affect more jabbed people than unjabbed… yeah ok then  #fearmongering #COVID #COVID19 #vaccineinjuries #VaccineDeaths

Personally, I didn't care much abt #COVID19 this year, except still wearing a mask when I go to the grocery store.
   But since infection rates are somewhat rising⸺from what I occasionally see⸺& next winter certainly coming, here's an interesting thread:
Stop posting this ignorant bullshit.

There isn't "natural immunity" to #COVID19 & there never will be. With the post-Omicron strains in particular, people can get reinfected on a monthly basis, with each subsequent reinfection likely being worse than the last. Fuck you 4 posting

Even in the Black Death only 50% of the population died-ie ~50% survived without vaccination. So vaccination apparently reduced the 50% -& pre 1st #covid19 dose many died or now have long #COVID symptoms. Herd immunity is app ~85% vacc so for whatever reason ~15% are unvacc & ok.

-NEW CASES rose by 37,591 (-67,247 the week prior)

We've been yo-yoing like this for two months now. Altogether it still looks like a plateau.
The #CDC, in updated guidance on June 24, says that children as young as 6 months may simultaneously receive #COVID19 injections and other routine #Vaccines on the same day—despite no safety study having been conducted by the vaccine manufacturers. https://theepochtimes.com/no-safety-data-to-back-cdcs-recommendation-on-co-administering-covid-19-injections-and-other-vaccines-in-children_4560494.html?utm_medium=Social&utm_source=gett…

The situation of #COVID19 in the world for this year only. Doesn't look like the pandemic is over.

This is more of an artistic impression, but you can see how dynamic it still is.
Medical centers around #Israel have reported an increase in hospitalized patients, those who are seriously ill and the number who have died.

#COVID19
It doesn't matter how many cases there are; only hospital admissions and deaths are important, and I  mean real deaths - not people who fell off a ladder and then died within 28 days of a positive #covid19 test!!
In #Massachusetts, #Covid19 hospitalizations rose slightly to 482 over the weekend as 9 deaths were reported. We're seeing slight increases in key numbers. Be careful and you should be fine. The risk level is moderate. Be smart. Be safe. #WearAMask in tight public spaces.

I suggest you listen to Dr. John Campbell from England if you think #COVID19 is over #BA5 While Alberta lays off 130 Covid data collectors as it pretends Covid is over. Getting rid of baseline data so they can hide what is happening #BestSummerEver 2.0

Same in NSW, Perrottet & Hazard will never be held to account for their actions eventhough they went against health advice.
Forecast is for 18,000 deaths this year from COVID19 with BA4/BA5 now causing chaos in Europe things will only get worse, wearing a mask is just so hard.

My 90 year old Mom recently went to a family memorial. She was the only attendee wearing a mask. The majority of family members in attendance have now tested positive for #COVID19 . Mom has tested negative twice. Fingers crossed.
Seems on-brand for the Horgan Government to pay for an advertising campaign to encourage residents to get COVID19 booster shots, and at the same time paying workers to tell residents trying to book a booster shot appointment that they are not eligible.

Also: Having COVID multiple times does not build up resistance or immunity

If you've had #COVID19 you can be reinfected weeks after getting it the 1st time. Experts say it may be less severe, but Covid can still damage your organs
For the best protection, the CDC recommends getting vaccinated and boosted. #ImmunizeElPaso call (915) 533-3414 #elpaso
Wow! Isn’t Science wonderful? Imagine a world without #COVID19 vaccines! Please #GetVaccinated if you haven’t had one, or haven’t had a booster.
Accessible transportation options are available for people with disabilities who want to get their COVID-19 vaccines in person. Call 311 or visit  https://on.nyc.gov/3GRT69l for more information about accessible transportation.

If a #war was killing 1000's of Americans every week, we'd definitely put a stop to it. There would be many marches (but nobody would wear masks.) 

Please wear a mask. Stop the deaths caused by #COVID19. It's not difficult but it is powerful.
Fiscal tightening will be needed in nearly all countries to stabilize public #debt. However, in many countries policymakers’ ability to do this may be restrained by budget rigidities that predated #COVID19 and might have intensified since

There won't be many pensioners left after govt. sanctioned culling via removal of all #covid19 restrictions. Ave of 40 ppl dying per day, mostly elders. That's 1300 per month. Combined with other causes of death the country may be 'rid' of pensioners in a couple of years.

An Rt of almost 1.6 for monkeypox?

Then we get a big problem. That would be a similar spread as currently with #Covid19 #BA5 .

Whereby here the real infection numbers for #COVID19  are probably significantly underestimated, because many cases are not reported.

You were right to doubt Dr. #JordanWalker's scientific acumen.  In video #2, Walker said he's not a scientist but worked as a business consultant before #Pfizer hired him to direct their #mRNA "strategic planning."  Mutating the #COVID19 virus could have been a profitable plan.

Imo it’s the covid19 jab that is predominantly responsible, however parliament must debate it .

You´re almost there ... so you are still believing covid is anything but a psy-ops? If anyone hadn't told you about "covid19" would you have noticed?
Pardon? Oh, that was you who needed to be pardoned.
And of that 1.1 million, 790,000 were 65 or older!

Covid19 was a massacre on the American elderly pop. But that's also partly bc 37 governors like NYCuomo that issued directives to have Covid+ Ppl put in nursing homes w old ppl who did NOT test Covid +

Since the start of the pandemic, 1,132,132 Americans have died from #COVID19 (16.8% of all deaths worldwide). That is about the same as 40,433 Great Flood of 1951s which killed 28 people in 1951:
At a meeting next week, the @US_FDA's advisory panel is set to consider annual #COVID19 #vaccine shots, per @thehill, which says they would be "akin to how flu vaccines are administered."

Rishi cofounded a hedge fund that invested a BILLION in Moderna, the COVID19 vaccine provider

ty for making this post, i was like half asleep angry posting about this this morning
that's the thing that's getting wiped from the convo which is so infuriating
I agree that vaccines are good.

However the Covid19 "vaccine" was not an actual vaccine. It was a delivery system for DNA modifying mRNA.
Translation:  Liberals don’t want it revealed where the money went. Many Liberals and friends of Liberals are much richer after the pandemic. Jane Fonda called covid19 a “gift from God” to the democrats…the pandemic was equally a gift from God to the Liberals
The rate of vaccination for #COVID19 in #Ukraine is around 18%

The people screaming for more are the same people that pished themselves in fear if the #unvaccinated came within 2 meters of them
  
Let that sink in
Ontario has released a billing code for doctors to use when diagnosing long COVID — a move doctors and advocates say is a crucial first step to better understanding, treating and destigmatizing a growing problem.

Millions were projected to be killed by Covid19. Of course Trump pushed for a quick vaccine. The vac did save countless lives of the vulnerable. But Dems couldn't stop mandating it to the healthy & children, even after it mutated to a less deadly form & after new health concerns.
Defamation? It's been in the news that a lab is making viruses to combat Covid19. That's why they had a variant that wasn't as lethal coming from a lab in South Africa.
What about COVID19 the most deadly pandemic ever???

CoVid19 was an intense experience of profound exhaustion with little other symptoms. A slight sinusitis that passed quickly. The depth of exhaustion was very scary and as that was worked through over 4 to 5 days it lifted and was gone. It was all consuming for its passing.
Trump is completely responsible for Covid19, no matter where it originated, & esp. if it was in another country (it was). He was the gatekeeper of our country, failed miserably, despite being briefed & given the playbook.
Democrats were forced to clean up his mess.
Typical angry lib! He’s probably really mad because of years of rejection from women! Now he wants to channel his anger towards opposing political views, even though the science is clear, masks do not work in regards to COVID19. Although it looks staged, I have met the angry Libs
Yes he conducted research prior to covid19 these are to my understanding attempts at a well sourced overview of his argument
Covid19 was an intelligence test.

Most media personalities failed it miserably.
It could be my fault these young sports people have tragically lost their lives.. I'm not 'vaccinated' against COVID19.

My last 'Granny' died about 40 years ago. However, we were all supposed to get jabbed 'or kill Granny'.. so presumably that was my fault too.

5/5 The whole Committee seemed to be uncertain about an annual #COVID19 #vaccine regime, except for kids and, as Dr. Offit emphasized, at-risk folks. I can’t say for sure, but it feels like there might be pushback against making the covid vaccine regime permanent.
2/5 The Committee discussed, but did not vote on, an annualized #COVID19 #vaccine program like with #flu vaccines. Based on what came out during the meeting, I don’t  think they have the votes to approve an annualized covid regime. And perhaps not for the reason you might think.

BREAKING: Pfizer's Director of Research admits conducting gain-of-function on Covid19 to make it more potent and fatal. 

In a world threatened by biological warfare, the last thing we want is gain-of-function research, that too conducted by corporations.
Proud to have worked on #COVAX which has now delivered 1.85 billion doses of #COVID19 vaccines globally to 146 countries in less than two years  A figure so high you can’t really process it.

The initiative was only set up with other @ACTAccelerator programmes in early-mid 2020
Data from the @uscensusbureau collected in late summer 2022 indicated that more than 1/4 of all #Colorado households with kids under 5 reported that their #childcare arrangement was disrupted at some point in the past 4 weeks because of the #COVID19 pandemic.(2/3)
It is an unsustainable, unhealthy and bad business model. No more and no less. A #private #company #Pfizer dictates #governments with a #public mandate in a way that does not match up with general health standards, let alone informed consent / #mRNA #Pfizer #COVID19 #vaccin

Yes. One. My husband got the first two shots but never got a booster. He's never had Covid19. Two weeks after my booster I came down for a week of misery and a month of lassitude.

Sure. But what about your master @realDonaldTrump who misled and lied about the seriousness and effects of the Covid19 and hundreds of thousands of Americans lives were lost? You are scared of @realDonaldTrump so you don't think Trump should be  held accountable!
Remember when it was against policy to scream on the roller coasters because of #Covid19?
In early February 2020, Trump sent nearly 18 tons of our PPE to China & left us unprepared. All while he was telling us Covid19 was nothing.
Did you remember to ignore a leftist today?
Don't you just love how their lies get exposed years later?

Because you and fox is not about free speech , you all are conspiracy propagandists, spreading lies about vote fraud, anti Vax propaganda.  You are vicariously responsible for many covid19  deaths. Shameful.

“The Chinese have mishandled COVID at every step of the way.”

Rep. @SethMoulton said he was “not entirely surprised” by the Dept. of @Energy’s assessment that a #WuhanLabLeak was the likely cause of the #COVID19 pandemic.
Breaking news today is COVID-19 came from a lab in China.  That was already discussed years ago..but the media said that kind of thinking was #racist.   Now hold China accountable. #chinavirus #COVID19
That #COVID19  started in nature and got out of the #Wuhan lab aren't diametrically opposed. It can, and more logically, seems like it's both. It probably started in nature and started infecting humans, and China studied it in a notoriously lax lab where it got out.

Not one single person will ever be held responsible for the COVID chaos they forced upon the world.

The U.S. Energy Department has assessed the #Covid19 pandemic and says the virus likely spread via a mishap at a #Chinese laboratory 

@VeronicaDudo reports
Facts for #BlackHistoryMonth: @CDCgov finds Black Americans are twice as likely as white Americans to be hospitalized because of #COVID19 & 1.6 times likely to die from it. Medically frail seniors are especially vulnerable. https://cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/investigations-discovery/hospitalization-death-by-race-ethnicity.html…

I see Ivermectin has been trending.. I didn’t tweet much about it during the pandemic as I had no idea whether it was effective against the ‘rona..

I kind of knew a Nobel Prize winning drug wasn’t ‘horse de-wormer’ and wasn’t likely to do anyone too much harm..

COVID likely came from a lab, masks don't work, and the vaccine doesn't stop the spread of #COVID19.

People got banned for saying all of these common sense things.

Just wait until they find out climate change is a lie as well.

but there are internet rumors that he conspired with CHINA TO CREATE Covid19 so....
Last fall, FDA said due to greater availability of #diagnostics, it will review fewer #COVID19 tests under EUA pathway. Instead, companies should file under traditional review pathways. Exempt are requests already under review, like Lucira’s.
In an 18-month span, #diagnostics developer @LuciraHealth went from pricing an upsized $160M IPO to recording a $107M charge. Its combination #COVID19 and #flu at-home test now has FDA authorization, but perhaps too late. $LHDX is in #bankruptcy.
2 years ago, we got briefly banned for saying as much. Now, evidence shows the contrary and our government officials urged the media & social media to sweep info under the rug while lying about it.
#COVID19
What was the "extra step" in the covid19 mutation? The f'ing lab?!
#Fauci #GainOfFunction, then headed the #COVID19 responses. The arsonist was the firefighter.
Yes. Simple. The name flu was replaced by the name covid19. Also most of the old folk who died in the first 'wave' were murdered with midazalam or remdesivir depending on your country's treatment protocol
moderna explicitly told the eu government they'd been working on a vaccine since 2017. its also on record that they were working with DARPA on coronavirus during that time. Finally, the most interesting part of the covid19 was the moderna owned chunks of DNA in the virus.

It wasn’t COVID19 they sought 2 cure it was injecting experimental DNA altering jabs into millions who died & others left disabled. Biden, Pfizer, Moderna & J&J did not have Emergency Use Authorization bcz ppl gave their consent 2 UNKNOWN dangerous adverse events @GovRonDeSantis
To Racist Tom, and many other @SenateGOP & @HouseGOP, Trump & @FOXTV Hosts, #COVID19 didn’t exist two years ago! They called it a complete hoax. And because of them & @FoxNews 1 Million+ people have died. Now they want an investigation of something that they said was no big deal!

The Dept of Energy is saying that a lab leak is the most likely origin of the COVID19. And this aligns with a previous conclusion made by the #FBI.

It's scary that 3 years into #COVID19 pandemic, so many people still have no idea that even a mild COVID infection can increase your risk of blood clots, heart problems, diabetes, and more. There needs to be more public education on serious health issues from COVID & #LongCOVID.

Since the start of the pandemic, 1,145,299 Americans have died from #COVID19 (16.8% of all deaths worldwide). That is about the same as 10,318 Centralia mine disasters which killed 111 people in 1947:
As of 2/25/23, the total number of #COVID19 cases confirmed among Houstonians since the start of the pandemic is 543,859. This includes 687 cases dated within the past 14 days not included in previous updates, 262 additional backlog cases, and the removal of 176 duplicates.

Note the Lancet Covid19 Commission and WHO have said lab origin is very plausible and requires investigation. It's odd as someone outside the US to see it become politicized. The Chair of the Lancet C19 Commission even outlined what US records to consider.
Firstly when president Xi told him it was a deadly virus, he should have be frank with Americans about how deadly it was and not a hoax, flu or cold 

Covid19 killed people in US cos it was politicised 

He even refused to wear a mask cos it didn’t look good on him

I believe all the Covid disinformation and antivaxx garbage before that was spread mostly by Russia. Before Covid SARS Putin wanted people in the West to get sick more often. Loss of work time =  weaker economy. Then with Covid19 he just wanted his opposition to die off.
There is no scientific consensus on the issue. The Lancet Covid19 Commission and WHO have said lab origin is very plausible and requires investigation. Hotez has funded research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology so has a huge conflict of interest.

92% of COVID19 deaths are currently people who were previously vaccinated.  Only 68% of the population is vaccinated.  Do the math.  The vaccines don't prevent death, don't prevent transmission, are ineffective - especially considering variants.  We were lied to.

Another "#Conspiracytheory" that turns out today to be true, COVID - 19 Most Likely a Lab Leak 
#covid19 #lableak
However, it looks like the risk to contract #LongCovid is much higher, IF
* immunity wanes
* #COVID19 #Virus is still around

Estimates are uncertain, probably 5% (vacc.) - 10% (unvacc.) PER infection ... so ...

don't catch it.

(no virus, no cry)
Well then we all know that's probably not the truth. The fact that the Left is pushing #Ukraine #BioWeapon Labs as misinformation and #Propaganda tells me that China is not the only Country at fault for #COVID19 development.

John Kirby of NSC wouldn’t confirm reports that @ENERGY believes COVID19 is a result of a China lab leak, but stressed @POTUS is the one who asked National Laboratories (part of Dept. Energy) to look into COVID origin. Will brief the public when there’s a clearer conclusion.
I luv how #SNL assumed he was one of them! #WoodyHarrelson #COVID19
Fauci independently filtered funds from medical groups to lobbyists to lower the pathogen control, opposed by Harvard professors, clearing the way for Wuhan to get built. 100% fact! Congress voted to lower standards as a result. 100% fact. Without those, there is no Covid19.
No, he doesn't! 

'The Energy Department has now concluded with "low confidence"...'

That's pretty close to "no confidence".

@dgurdasani1 Reading this thread one would never sensibly not question everything. 3 years in to #covid19 , Twitter files dropping truths, Excess death in every over vaxxed country in the world. Yet you have had multiple jabs…. I told the NHS jab police to get lost.
What a shocker! Trump was right again!!! #Wuhan #COVID19
Could you help me track down a tweet from Elon Musk where he said that Fauci was the source of the covid19 through an NGO? I can not find it despite all my research on the net. Thank you in advance and cordially from Corsica
